# CTF N26 Writeup 27 MAY [unsolved]

Found a challenge @ https://medium.com/insiden26/n26-security-3-0-81a4e85c5fe8
Downloaded a qr code as usual and parsed with CyberChef, normalized it has a link:

```

```

There's an encoded base 64 string, time to decode.

In windows :

```
certutil -decode first_base64.txt decoded
```

Its a zip archive with a .png image inside, using binwalk i see it has a footer.

```bash
root@kali:~/Desktop/27MAY# binwalk -I decoded

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 209501, uncompressed size: 212209, name: result.png
209649        0x332F1         End of Zip archive, footer length: 22
```

I just extract all, with a deep scan
```bash
binwalk -eIMD 32 decoded 
```
There are many files:

Using Stegsolve 1.3 on that image, Red, Blue,Green 6 have a hidden QR code

Inside this qr code there's this:

```
_t_p_:_/_i_t_g_t_u_._o_/_8_8_b_2_a_0_3_7_8_d_4_5_3_0_e_1
```

seems like a gist git url...
